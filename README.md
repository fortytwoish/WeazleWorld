# WeazleWorld

WeazleWorld was a very ambitious project by a 3-man team during college. The time frame was 6 weeks (during holidays).

<b>My part</b> was the entirety of the procedural island generation and rendering with everything on it, as well as the first mini game.

The task was to build a game for elementary school children using HTML, CSS and JavaScript in some form.
We decided pretty quickly that we wanted to build a 3D game, because it had never been done there. The decision
to use the three.js framework (<a href="https://threejs.org/">https://threejs.org/</a>) followed shortly after because I had already tinkered with it before.

As for the topic, I had always wanted to try <b>procedural generation</b>.
