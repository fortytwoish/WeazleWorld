# WeazleWorld

WeazleWorld was a very ambitious project by a 3-man team during college. The time frame was 6 weeks (during holidays).

The task was to build a game for elementary school children using HTML, CSS and JavaScript in some form.

We used https://threejs.org/ to build a procedural island and populated it with child-friendly minigames.
